### Description

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. OpenCV can be used as image and video processing tool as well as tool for more complicated applications. 

My repository containes simple scripts for image, video and stream processing and some detection scripts, including scripts using DNN module. They are useful when making some bigger project, I can adapt them and use them there without need to write everything from the start.
